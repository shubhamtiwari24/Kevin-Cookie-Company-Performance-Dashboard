# Kevin-Cookie-Company-Performance-Dashboard

I am very excited to share another project that I have currently Completed on Excel. The name of my project is "Kevin Cookie Company Performance Dashboard" The main objective of this project is to create a performance dashboard using Excel to analyze profit by market and cookies type, the total no of units of cookies sold each month, and total profit.


To achieve the goal of this project, I have completed several tasks.


âœ… Understanding the Whole dataset properly.

âœ… Then I checked whether the data sets contain null values or duplicate values.

âœ… The Data Sets are cleaned already and do not contain any null values or duplicate values.

âœ… Created Pivot tables, Charts, and Graphs ðŸ“Š to summarise the data and visually get quick information and make it easier to understand.

âœ… Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel with inserting slicers and timelines, which allows users to interact with the data.

 Key insights :
 
âœ… The total no of cookies sold by Kevin in the United Kingdom and lowest in the Philippines.

âœ… The maximum no of profit earned by Kevin in the month of October and minimum in May.

âœ… The maximum no of units sold in the month of October and the minimum in the month of May.
